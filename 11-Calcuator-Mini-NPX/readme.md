* Begin by creating a main.ts file in your project directory to store your TypeScript code.
* Initialize TypeScript configuration by executing tsc --init.
* Initiate a Node.js project with npm init -y.
* Ensure TypeScript types for Node.js are installed by running npm i @types/node -D.
* Update the package.json file to include "type": "module" and "bin": "main.js" after the main property.
* Configure the tsconfig.json file, setting "target": "ES2022", "module": "nodenext", and "moduleResolution": "nodenext".
* Compile your TypeScript code to JavaScript using tsc.
* Execute the compiled JavaScript code with node main.js.
* Optionally, publish your application to npm using npm publish.
* Install and run your application from npm using npm install <your-app-name> and npx <your-app-name>.
* Congratulations! If everything runs smoothly, you've successfully created and published your first TypeScript app!
